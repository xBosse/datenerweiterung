          German Coarse-grained Opinion Role Lexicon

===============================================================

1.  Description of the Data

The file

coarse_grained_opinion_role_lexicon_verbs_german.txt

contains a coarse-grained opinion role lexicon for German opinion verbs.

It covers the verbs of the PolArt-sentiment lexicon (Klenner et al., 2009).
The format is identical to the English coarse-grained lexicon. Therefore, more details regarding the format can be found in

CoarseGrainedOpinionRoleLexicon/README

Note that unlike the English coarse-grained lexicon, there is no German fine-grained counterpart for the coarse-grained version.
Therefore, the German coarse-grained version was not automatically converted from a fine-grained lexicon but manually compiled (from scratch).
For that annotation, German online-dictionaries were used, such as 
 
www.duden.de
www.dwds.de 

On a subset of 400 randomly sampled verbs, a pairwise agreement of Cohen's Kappa of K=0.7 was measured. (This is agreement can be regarded as substantial.)
